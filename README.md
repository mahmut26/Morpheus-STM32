# Morpheus-STM32 (work in progress)
A cheap 3D printer controller board for use with a "Blue Pill" STM32F1 generic board. Inspired on http://reprap.org/wiki/SinapTec

Design goals:
---------------

 - Follow the [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
 - Low cost
 - Single layer copper board
 - DIY-able (easy to make via toner transfer)
 - Only through-hole components
 - The very basic a printer would need
   - Keep bed circuit separated/optional (if you are making a PLA only printer without a heated bed, you don't need to populate the bed circuit zone)
 - Open Source Hardware, made in Open Source Software

Features:
---------------

 - 4 Pololu-like steppers (X, Y, Z, E0)
 - 3 mosfets (Hotend heater, print cooling fan and bed heater)
 - 3 MIN endstops (X, Y, Z)
 - Z Probe pin (in case you are building a delta printer and need the extra endstop)
 - 2 thermistors (for E0 and bed)
 - 2 12V fan connectors
 - I2C and SPI header
  
 # WARNING:
 - All logic voltage in this board is 3.3V. Do not connect 5V logic addons/devices without proper level adapting.
 - ~This board has no reverse current protection,~ it has a diode to short-circuit and protect the board in case of reverse current, but if you connect power incorrectly you'll still damage components and/or your power supply (there's also a risk of caching fire, so please be careful).
 - This board has no overcurrent protection, please use a fuse on power input (e.g. auto-blade or inline fuse holder), recommended values are of 5A for the main board and 10A for the bed circuit.
 - Check all connections before plugging power.
 - Now for real, check connections...
 
 Notes:
 ---------------
 - Usually, "blue pill" boards have a wrong R10 value (USB pullpup resistor, should be 1.5k but manufcturers place a 10k or other value resistor instead), so you can add a 1.8k in R13. If your board has the correct value or you already fixed it in the board, then leave R13 unpopulated.
 - ~Hotend sensor uses a 1k resistor pullup (R1). Anyway, if you're having trouble with finding (or creating) thermistor tables, just replace it with a 4.7k resistor and use the usual Marlin tables.~ 
  Now Marlin has configurable thermistors, you can use thermistor **1000** in **configuration.h** and choose pull-up, ressistance and beta values in **configuration_adv.h**

Now you can use firmware.bin.
